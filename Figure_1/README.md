## Figure 1 plotting 

The starting inputs for this script are 1) the multi-sample (full cohort) Seurat object and 2) the multi-Sample ArchR project. The outputs are the UMAP plots and proportion bar charts presented in Figure 1. 

### [/Figure_1/Figure_1.R](https://github.com/RegnerM2015/scENDO_scOVAR_2020/tree/main/Figure_1)

1. Plot scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq UMAP plots colored by sample
1. Plot scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq UMAP plots colored by cell type
1. Plot proportion bar charts for scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq showing the contribution of each patient to each cell type subcluster
