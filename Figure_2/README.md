1. Plot histograms of correlation values and p-values for both observed and null condition
2. Plot bar charts for peaks per gene and genes per peak information
3. Plot scATAC-seq browser track for gene of interest and corresponding scRNA-seq expression in violin plot
4. Plot violin plot for RHEB and for pathway expression signature calculated by Seurat's *AddModuleScore()*

**NOTE:** the peak-to-gene link heatmap and venn diagram were generated from https://github.com/RegnerM2015/scENDO_scOVAR_2020/blob/main/PeaktoGeneLink_Analysis/Full_Cohort/FullCohort_P2G.R
