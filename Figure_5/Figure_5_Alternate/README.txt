This Folder contains the alternate workflow for TFSEE/Figure 5. The manuscript version (Figure_5) uses all marker enhancers enriched in the following cell type clusters:

  1) 0-Fibroblast
  2) 27-Fibroblast
  3) All remaining epithelial cell type subclusters 
  
The alternate version (Figure_5_Alternate) uses only marker enhancers enriched in the following cell type clusters with 100% patient specifity:

cell type subclusters used in Figure_5_Alternate <- c("32-Unciliated epithelia 1",
                   "22-Unciliated epithelia 1",
                   "19-Epithelial cell",
                   "35-Epithelial cell",
                   "1-Epithelial cell",
                   "10-Epithelial cell",
                   "16-Fibroblast",
                   "18-Epithelial cell",
                   "0-Fibroblast",
                   "27-Fibroblast",
                   "9-Epithelial cell")

Note that this means that enhancers enriched in clusters 11, 23, and 21 are not used in the Figure_5 analysis (manuscript version).
