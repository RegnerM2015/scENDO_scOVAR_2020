## Figure 3 plotting 

The starting inputs for this script are 1) the multi-sample (EEC cohort) Seurat object, 2) the multi-Sample ArchR project with EEC peak-to-gene associations, and 3) the EEC peak-to-gene link metadata. The outputs are the UMAP plots, proportion bar charts, expression boxplots for the gene of interest, and the ATAC browser track for the gene of interest presented in Figure 3. 

### [/Figure_3/Figure_3.R](https://github.com/RegnerM2015/scENDO_scOVAR_2020/tree/main/Figure_3)

1. Plot scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq UMAP plots colored by sample
1. Plot scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq UMAP plots colored by cell type
1. Plot proportion bar charts for scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq showing the contribution of each patient to each cell type subcluster
1. Plot scATAC-seq browser track for gene of interest and corresponding scRNA-seq expression in box plot
