# Reproducibility
### /sessionInfo-4.txt
List of R packages and versions needed to reproduce the results with R version 4.0.2 unless otherwise noted

### /scENDO_scOVAR.yml 
Conda environment information (package verisons) to reproduce the results with R version 4.0.3 unless otherwise noted

### IMPORTANT NOTE: the ArchR package (https://github.com/GreenleafLab/ArchR) was extensively used for the scATAC-seq analysis. These scripts use ArchR version 0.9.5, but we highly recommend to update to the latest version of ArchR.
