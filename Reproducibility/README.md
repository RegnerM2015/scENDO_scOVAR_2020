# Reproducibility
### /sessionInfo-4.txt
List of R packages and versions needed to reproduce the results with R version 4.0.2 unless otherwise noted. Please be sure to check the other sessionInfo files under each corresponding analysis folder as some of them may list additional software tools with different versions. 

### /scENDO_scOVAR.yml 
Conda environment information (package verisons) to reproduce the results with R version 4.0.3 unless otherwise noted. Not all R packages in the conda environment transferred to the yml file so please be sure to check the other sessionInfo files under each corresponding analysis folder as some of them may list additional software tools with different version. 

### IMPORTANT NOTE: the ArchR package (https://github.com/GreenleafLab/ArchR) was extensively used for the scATAC-seq analysis. These scripts use ArchR version 0.9.5, but we highly recommend to update to the latest version of ArchR.
